  <h1>£1500pcm Room for rent in Ice Wharf, Kings Cross</h1>

  <div class="text-body">
    <p>
<p>
  Available Jan 2026! <br>
  A modern, bright and spacious 2 bedroom apartment for rent in the highly sought after Ice Wharf development next to Regent's Canal.
  Spanning approximately 777 sq ft, this property benefits from secure gates and 24-hour concierge service.
</p>

<p>
  Me: I am a Senior Research Fellow working full-time at UCL. I have been in London long-term and will be for the forseeable future. 
  I have lived here for almost 3 years and the landlord has been happy to extend the contract. However my flatmate is leaving in January 2026 (end of an era)
  and I'm looking for someone to take over his room.
  We will be splitting electricity (generally 80 in summer months, 200 in winter months) and wifi (40 per month),
  and council tax is not included.
</p>
<p>
  The flat is situated on the Third Floor, with lift access, the apartment has a large living/dining area, kitchen, 
  2 double bedrooms, good sized shared bathroom, and balcony, 1GB/s high speed wifi. 

  The compound is gated, with long-term bike parking (£1/week) and also car parking.
</p>
<p>
  The location is amazing! Nearby are various amenities, including Waitrose, Granary Square, Coal Drops Yard and a wide range of restaurants and bars.
  Coal Drops Yard is lively especially on the weekends and in summer, and there are always some open-air markets going on. We are also just 10 minutes walk from King's Cross St. Pancras (Metropolitan, Piccadilly, Victoria, Northern, Hammersmith and City and Circle lines and British Rail) 
  which offers local, national and international transport links via the Eurostar at St. Pancras. We are also next to the London Canal Museum if you fancy a boat ride.
</p>

<p>
  King's Cross has recently opened its new shopping centre, the 'Coal Drops Yard'. 
  The site, which was originally established in 1850 to handle the eight million tonnes of coal, 
  has now been transformed to become an incredible space housing a mix of 50 concept stores, bars, restaurants and public spaces.
